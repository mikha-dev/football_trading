# Models for football prediction

This projects has been created to design and test different models for the prediction of football games. The aim of these models is to provide pre-match probabilities to a real-time odds trading model (private project) which will operate on the Betfair Exchange API.

### Current models being developed

- XGBoost - (90% Complete)

- LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (30% Complete)
