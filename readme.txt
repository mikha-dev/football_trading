# Models for football prediction

This projects has been created to design and test different models for the prediction of football games. The aim of these models is to provide pre-match probabilities to a real-time odds trading model (private project) which will operate on the Betfair Exchange API.

### Current models being developed

- XGBoost - (90% Complete)

- LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (30% Complete)

To DO

- Use the FPL fixtures table to get the games for the next game week.

- Create a dashboard to monitor model performance and post predictions

- Each week, download the fixtures for the upcoming game week and serve them to the model API.

- Load the previous years player-level data into this DB and experiment with player-level features.
